# How to Create a New Project

You can **create a new project** in four different ways. When you click on the New button, your options are:

1. **Build from scratch**

    To create a new form from scratch, you can input project details and clik Create Project. 
    
2. **Use a template**  

    To use a template, you need to first go to Library and create one. 
    
3. **Upload an XLSForm**  
    
    Import an existing form from an external file in the [XLSForm format](http://xlsform.org/en), for example when sharing form drafts between colleagues.
    
4. **Import an XLSForm via URL**

    Enter a valid XLSForm URL to import an existing form.

The **Project List View** shows all of the projects that have been created in, and shared with your account. To open a project, just click on its title. In this view, you can also organize your projects (add project tags, archive, or delete), download a project's form, or clone the form to use in a new project.

**Downloads** are possible in two different formats:  

1. **XLS**
    
    Allowing you to share it with others through the XLSForm format, or edit it in a spreadsheet program such as Excel
    
2. **XML**  
    
    Allowing you to manually copy it to an Android device running KoBoCollect (not recommended - only for advanced users)
