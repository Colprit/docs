# How to Create a New Project

You can create a new project in two different ways. When you click on the New button, your options are to either:

* **Start from Scratch**    

    Create a new form from scratch, using our Form Builder  
    
* **Upload XLS Form**  

    Import an existing form from an external file in the [XLSForm format](http://xlsform.org/en), for example when sharing form drafts between colleagues.

The Project List view shows all of the projects that have been created in, and shared with, your account. To open a project, just click on its title. In this view, you can also organize your projects (add project tags, archive, or delete), download a project's form, or clone the form to use in a new project.

Downloads are possible in two different formats:  

* **XLS**  

    Allowing you to share it with others through the XLSForm format, or edit it in a spreadsheet program such as Excel
    
* **XML**  

    Allowing you to manually copy it to an Android device running KoBoCollect (not recommended - only for advanced users)
