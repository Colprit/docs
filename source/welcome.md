## What can KoboToolbox do?

KoboToolbox allows you to easily develop digital data collection forms that work on both mobile devices and web browsers. 


**Creating forms** is quick and simple, thanks to our easy-to-use online form builder. You can also use the [XLSFORM](https://xlsform.org) specification and upload your xlsform files directly to the platform, which will provide you with the flexibility to build more complex and endlessly customizable forms. These files will be rendered automatically as forms in KoboToolbox.


Completed forms can then be shared online or downloaded onto mobile devices, ready to use for data collection. The KoboCollect Android app allows for **offline data collection**, storing recorded data in the device until an internet connection is available and the data can be sent to the server. This ensures that even in network-constrained environments, any kind of data, from text to video to GPS coordinates, can be collected without internet connection.

Besides the KoboCollect app, KoboToolbox also allows for **online and offline data collection** through any web browser using any device or operating system. This option is powered by Enketo web forms, and can work on any mobile phone, tablet or computer. Simply share the URL of your form and you’ll be able to start collecting data.

KoboToolbox also allows you to **manage your data** by aggregating the data collected from different devices into a single database. This data can then be downloaded into multiple formats for use in applications such as Excel, SPSS or GIS software.

In addition to being able to access your data by simply downloading it, KoboToolbox also offers a robust API (application programming interface). This allows other applications to access the data in real time, enabling you to further process and analyse your data.

## Who is behind KoboToolbox

KoboToolbox is developed by the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative and led by co-founders [Phuong Pham](http://hhi.harvard.edu/people/phuong-pham) and [Patrick Vinck](http://hhi.harvard.edu/people/patrick-vinck), who created the first iteration of KoboToolbox back in 2009 in response to their own research needs while working in the field.

Today, we are a fully independent Non-Profit Organization with a team of more than 15 professionals working hard to make these tools useful and accessible to everyone. To learn more about our organization please visit our [About Us page](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/kobo/).

KoboToolbox is funded entirely through generous grants and donations from [our partners](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/#partners).

## KoboToolbox components

KoboToolbox uses a robust set of components that make developing forms and collecting and managing data possible. 

### 1. Formbuilder

![Formbuilder](/images/welcome/formbuilder.png)

The Formbuilder allows you to design forms easily and intuitively, without the need to use complex syntax. 

The formbuilder supports a wide range of question types such as text, numbers, multiple choice, media, GPS and many others.

You can also add simple to advanced form logic –such as calculated fields, skip logic or validation criteria– through the form builder interface. Forms created using xlsform and uploaded to KoboToolbox can also be further edited in the Formbuilder.

### 2. Library
  
![Formbuilder](/images/welcome/library.png)

The question library allows users to save and organize questions that can then be added to their projects. The library also acts as a public repository of questions, blocks of questions and complete form templates contributed by other KoboToolbox users and available for everyone to use. With the question library, you are able to quickly build advanced forms with complex logic by utilizing question blocks or templates that were pre-developed by others.


### 3. KoboCollect
  
![Formbuilder](/images/welcome/kobocollect.png)

The KoboCollect android app is used [for collecting data on mobile devices](kobocollect_on_android_latest.md). Once the app has been configured to connect to the form author’s KoboToolbox account, forms can be downloaded into the app ready for data collection. These forms will work even without an internet connection. Once the mobile device has access to internet connection, the collected data can then be transferred to the KoboToolbox platform. You can download the [latest version of KoboCollect on the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.koboc.collect.android).


### 4. Enketo web forms
  
![Formbuilder](/images/welcome/enketo.png)

In addition to the KoboCollect mobile application, [data can also be collected using Enketo web forms](data_through_webforms.md).

These forms can be sent to respondents for online data entry on their mobile devices, laptops or desktops. Much like KoboCollect, they can also be used for offline data entry, particularly in cases where responses will be recorded by enumerators (data collectors), instead of the respondents themselves. While responses can be stored offline once the form has been loaded, the browser will initially need an internet connection to load the form.

### 5. Data management

![Formbuilder](/images/welcome/data_management.png)

KoboToolbox allows for data to be collected from multiple devices. Data for a single project is then aggregated into a single database. This data can then be reviewed, edited and downloaded by the account owner or those given permission.

Data collected for each project can be managed in the table view, where each submission received will be displayed as a row. Additionally, your data can be visualized as part of a report, where different options are available to create multiple charts and summary tables.

If you collected GPS points as part of your project, you can also view the data plotted on a map.

Data can be downloaded in multiple formats and using customizable settings. In addition, you have the ability to download all media collected as part of your project such as audios, videos and photos.

### Project management

![Formbuilder](/images/welcome/project_management.png)

The KoboToolbox platform has a number of features that allow users to manage other aspects of their project. For example, you can share projects with other users within the same KoboToolbox server, control which parts of the projects other people can change using granular sharing permissions, and also who can send submissions to the project.

Apart from this, you are also able to pull data from one project into another to develop advanced projects with case management capabilities.

### 5. KoboToolbox API

The application programming interface (API) enables you to pull data from KoboToolbox directly into other applications. This feature allows for easy integration with common software such as Excel, PowerBI and others, permitting real time sharing of data with these applications, without having to download any files.

Intermediate and advanced users may use this feature to build interactive data dashboards and other data-driven applications. [Learn more about the KoboToolbox API on the linked support article](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/api.html).

## What is the cost of KoboToolbox?

Our platform is open source and entirely free to use. We work hard to make this possible, and collaborate with many partners to keep KoboToolbox available to everyone at no cost.

We believe that organizations, particularly those dedicated to research, humanitarian efforts or any other social good, should be able to collect data in a reliable and timely manner. Quickly collecting trustworthy information in a humanitarian crisis will contribute to saving lives and protecting the most vulnerable. Financial resources should not be a barrier to this important work, and to that purpose, we prioritize maintaining free access to our tool. Of course, this has a cost for us, which we are only able to absorb thanks to the help of generous donations from our partners.

As a result, there are some limitations to the services we are able to offer for free. After a certain storage limit, we will ask you to download and remove data from your account before continuing to collect new data. Alternatively, you can get in touch with us to pay for additional storage limits, at cost. Unfortunately, we don’t have the capacity to offer unlimited data storage to everyone for free, and for this reason we do not recommend using KoboToolbox for long-term data storage.

## What languages are supported?

Projects in KoboToolbox can be created in any language as well as in multiple languages. Adding translations is entirely manual, and there are no limitations to what languages or number of translations can be added.

Our user interface supports English, French, Spanish, Arabic, Hindi, Kurdish, and Chinese at the moment. If you have found any issues with these translations, or would like to see the interface available in a new language, please consider volunteering your skills to support our translation efforts by [getting in touch with us here!](mailto:translations@kobotoolbox.org)

## Who is KoboToolbox for?

KoboToolbox was built for human rights and humanitarian aid professionals but can be used to suit any of your research needs. Currently, our users range from city and state government officials, search and rescue teams, UN agencies, large and small NGOs, to business consulting and accounting firms.
