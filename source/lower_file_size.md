How To Lower the File Size of Collected Media
=============================================

When your form collects more than 1 image - or you are collecting tens of thousands of records -  you could face difficulties when attempting to generate the Media Attachments ZIP if you do not adjust the image quality settings before starting data collection. 

Open Camera is a 3rd party open-source application that can help you do this.

**Instructions**

`Install Open Camera <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.sourceforge.opencamera&hl=en_US>`_ from the Android Play Store.

**KoBoCollect**

In KoBoCollect, when you take a photo you will now be asked which app should be used by default: Choose Open Camera and select 'Always' so you are not asked again.

**Open Camera**

In the Open Camera settings, go to Photo Settings, then:

1. Open Camera Resolution and choose the smallest acceptable resolution
2. Open image quality and choose a percentage. 90% will still look almost perfect, below 50% the image will become harder to recognize. Start with 70% and test some images at different quality levels to find the lowest acceptable size.
