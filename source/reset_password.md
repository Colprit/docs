**Last updated:** <a href="https://github.com/kobotoolbox/docs/blob/7590fa2ddca50cffc82051199410ccce4b3a130e/source/reset_password.md" class="reference">10 Jun 2020</a>

If you have forgotten or lost your account password, KoBoToolbox allows you to reset it easily.

To reset your password:

* For Humanitarian Organizations using the **UN OCHA server** (unlimited use): Go to [kobo.humanitarianresponse.info](kobo.humanitarianresponse.info)
* For Researchers, Aid Workers, & Everyone Else using the **HHI server**: Go to [kf.kobotoolbox.org](kf.kobotoolbox.org)

* Click **Forgot?** on the login form.
* Enter your email address.
* Click **Reset Password**.

KoBoToolbox will then send out password reset emails after your request to reset the password. If you didn't receive an email with the password reminder link, please try troubleshooting the following:

* Check if our password reset email landed in your spam or junk mail folder, as it might have been placed there by your email provider.
* Check if you created your account with a different email address - simply click on the 'Forgot' link again and enter your alternative email address.
* It might also be that you are requesting to reset your password on the wrong server. Check the URL on your address bar to ensure you are on the server where you had created your account on, [whether the HHI server](https://kf.kobotoolbox.org) or the [UN OCHA server](https://kobo.humanitarianresponse.info]).

If you still have not received the email with the reset link, and you have tried all the troubleshooting options provided above, please send an email with the subject “Password reset issues” to [support@kobotoolbox.org](mailto:support@kobotoolbox.org) with your username, the email address you used to sign up, and which server you created your account on.
