KoboToolbox is free and open source software that can be installed on any
computer or server. The vast majority of users use one of the two options: The
**[Humanitarian Server](https://kobo.humanitarianresponse.info)** hosted by UN
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) or the
**[Non-Humanitarian Server](https://kf.kobotoolbox.org)** hosted by KoboToolbox. The
use of KoboToolbox on either server is free to everyone, but there are certain
differences and limitations you should know:

| &nbsp;       | Humanitarian Server        | Non-Humanitarian Server |
| :----------- | :------------------------- | :---------------------- |
| Intended For | Humanitarian Organizations | Everyone Else           |
| Price        | Free                       | Free                    |
| Projects     | Unlimited                  | Unlimited               |
| Submissions  | Unlimited                  | 10,000 Per Calendar Month        |
| Data Storage | Unlimited                  | 5GB Total               |

Anyone working for an organization providing
**[humanitarian assistance](https://web.archive.org/web/20171102215158/http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/data-guides/defining-humanitarian-aid)**
is free to use the Humanitarian Server provided by OCHA.

If you're using the **Non-Humanitarian Server** and plan to exceed the monthly
submission or storage limits, please email
**[info@kobotoolbox.org](mailto:info@kobotoolbox.org)** to discuss feasibility and
potential extra costs.

<p class="note">
  A <strong>very important</strong> thing to keep in mind is that sharing
  projects and data between the two servers is not possible. This means all
  users working on a shared project need to be using the same server to do so.
