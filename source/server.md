# Which Server Should I Use?
**Last updated:** <a href="https://github.com/kobotoolbox/docs/blob/6f4c3b102704a1ffe01cb6334eb8d52cbd99ef22/source/server.md" class="reference">9 Aug 2021</a>

KoboToolbox is free and open source software that can be installed on any computer or server. The vast majority of users use one of the two options: The [Humanitarian Server](https://kobo.humanitarianresponse.info) hosted by UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) or the [Non-Humanitarian Server](https://kf.kobotoolbox.org) hosted by KoboToolbox. The use of KoboToolbox on either server is free to everyone, but there are certain differences and limitations you should know:

| &nbsp;       | Humanitarian Server        | Non-Humanitarian Server |
| ---          | ---                        | ---                     |
| Intended For | Humanitarian Organizations | Everyone Else           |
| Price        | Free                       | Free                    |
| Projects     | Unlimited                  | Unlimited               |
| Submissions  | Unlimited                  | 10,000 Per Month        |
| Data Storage | Unlimited                  | 5GB Total               |


Anyone working for an organization providing [humanitarian assistance](http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/data-guides/defining-humanitarian-aid.) is free to use the Humanitarian Server provided by OCHA. 

If you're using the **Non-Humanitarian Server** and plan to exceed the monthly submission or storage limits, please email [info@kobotoolbox.org](mailto:info@kobotoolbox.org) to discuss feasibility and potential extra costs. 

<p class="note">A <strong>very important</strong> thing to keep in mind is that sharing projects and data between the two servers is not possible. This means all users working on a shared project need to be using the same server to do so.</p>
