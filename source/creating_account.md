# Creating an account on KoboToolbox

The first step for all users when getting started with KoboToolbox is to create an account.This article will guide you through the steps on creating and accessing your account on one of KoboToolbox servers.

## How to access KoboToolbox

There are two main ways of accessing KoboToolbox:

1. **Public servers**: For most users, it is recommended to use either of our publicly available KoboToolbox servers listed on the [Get Started page](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/#sign-up). One server is for humanitarian organizations and the non-humanitarian server is for everyone else. Steps for creating an account are listed below.[a][b]

2. **Install KoboToolbox on your own server**: Advanced users can install KoBoToolbox on their own server (or on a local computer or device) using Docker.
