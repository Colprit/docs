# Creating an account on KoBoToolbox

The first step for all users when getting started with **KoBoToolbox** is to
create an account. This article will guide you through the steps on creating and
accessing your account on one of **KoBoToolbox** servers.

## How to access KoBoToolbox

There are two main ways of accessing **KoBoToolbox**:

1. **Public servers**: For most users, it is recommended to use either of our
   publicly available **KoBoToolbox** servers listed on the
   [Get Started page](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/#sign-up). One server is for
   humanitarian organizations and the non-humanitarian server is for everyone
   else. Steps for creating an account are listed below.

2. **Install KoBoToolbox on your own server**: Advanced users can install
   **KoBoToolbox** on [their own server](kobo_your_servers.md) (or on a
   [local computer or device](kobo_local_computer.md)) using Docker. For more
   details on how to install your own instance of **KoBoToolbox**,
   [visit our kobo-install repository on GitHub](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kobo-install).

## Creating an account

If you are an individual researcher, aid worker, or a for-profit organization,
it is recommended to use the server provided by **KoBoToolbox** (_HHI server_).

If you are creating an account for a humanitarian organization, it is
recommended that you use the server provided by **UN OCHA** (_OCHA server_).
