**Last updated:** <a href="https://github.com/kobotoolbox/docs/blob/511ea4cb3c698a4b45e7c2b4efd1af4e356e811f/source/creating_account.md" class="reference">15 Feb 2022</a>

The first step for all users when getting started with **KoboToolbox** is to
create an account. This article will guide you through the steps on creating and
accessing your account on one of **KoboToolbox** servers.

## How to access KoboToolbox

There are two main ways of accessing **KoboToolbox**:

1. **Public servers**: For most users, it is recommended to use either of our
   publicly available **KoboToolbox** servers listed on the
   [Get Started page](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/#sign-up). One server is for
   humanitarian organizations and the non-humanitarian server is for everyone
   else. Steps for creating an account are listed below.

2. **Install KoboToolbox on your own server**: Advanced users can install
   **KoboToolbox** on [their own server](kobo_your_servers.md) (or on a
   [local computer or device](kobo_local_computer.md)) using Docker. For more
   details on how to install your own instance of **KoboToolbox**,
   [visit our kobo-install repository on GitHub](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kobo-install).

## Creating an account

-   To create a new account on **KoboToolbox**, go to the
    [KoboToolbox homepage](https://kobotoolbox.org) and click **SIGN UP** on the
    menu. This will take you to the **GET STARTED** section of the website.

-   Here, you are presented with two different servers where you can create your
    account.

If you are an individual researcher, aid worker, or a for-profit organization,
it is recommended to use the server provided by **KoboToolbox** (_Kobo server_).

If you are creating an account for a humanitarian organization, it is
recommended that you use the server provided by **UN OCHA** (_OCHA server_).

**KoboToolbox** will send you an email with a link to activate your account. If
you did not get the activation email, check your spam folder. For more help, you
can also read the support article

-   Log in to the email address you used when creating your account and click
    the activation link sent to you. This will automatically log you into
    **KoboToolbox**.
