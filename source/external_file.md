# Select One or Many From External File Question Type

In some cases, it may be desirable to host a list of choice options in an external file, rather than directly in the project XLSForm. For example, a long list of choices (e.g. hundreds or thousands) could slow down the loading and navigation of the form, or replacing an xlsform to make edits to or add new choice options after data collection has begun could sometimes be troublesome. 
This article provides a detailed example and method for creating a select one or select many question type with the choice list in a separate external file. 
Please note: 
•	At the moment, this feature is only available using XLSForms and the data can only be entered through Enketo and is not supported by ODK or KoBoCollect. 
•	There is an outstanding bug that causes an error when trying to view or download the collected data. For now, you can go around this by using the legacy version of KoBo (kc.kobotoolbox.org or kc.humanitarianresponse.info)
