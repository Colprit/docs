<p class="note">Please note that <strong>changing</strong> the question type is currently not supported and may result in unexpected results. If the form has already been deployed, use a question with a different XML name, even if the label remains the same.<p/>

## Adding a question hint
A question hint is text that is shown below the question text on the form. You can use it to provide extra instruction on how to answer the question.

To add a question hint, just click __Question hint__ below the question text and type it.
