#### Changing question settings

To access advanced features for each question click on the Settings cog in the top-right corner of the question. Here you can modify further details of the question, such as skip logic, validating responses, setting question hints, making a question required, etc. More information on this is available in the respective sections for [Question Options](question_options.html), [Skip Logic](skip_logic.html), and [Validation Criteria](validation_criteria.html).

#### Adding questions to the library

In order to reuse a question in future forms, you can click on 'Add Question to Library'. It will be saved in your Question Library as a copy, meaning that you can make further changes to the original question in the form or even delete it, without affecting the copy that has been placed in the library.
