# Row-Level Permissions

The __row-level__ permissions are an extension of the [existing permissions](managing_permissions.md) features and allow project owners to create four different levels of permissions for a shared project. To find this functionality, simply go to project __SETTINGS__ and click on the __Sharing__ section. You will see a screen as shown below.

As of August 2021, the management of project permissions has been extended to allow for a total of four __row-level__ access permissions that include:

| Row-level permission                              | Description                                                                                                                    |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| __View submissions only from specific users__     | _View data_ submitted by a subset of defined data entry users.                                                                 |
| __Edit submissions only from specific users__     | _Edit data_ submitted by a subset of defined data entry users.                                                                  |
| __Delete submissions only from specific users__   | _Delete data_ submitted by a subset of defined data entry users.                                                               |
| __Validate submissions only from specific users__ | <a class="reference" href="record_validation.html"><i>Validate data</i></a> submitted by a subset of defined data entry users. |

<p class="note">Please note that some permissions imply others. For example, if <i>Alice</i> has <strong>Edit submissions only from specific users</strong> only for <i>Bob</i>, then this implies that <i>Alice</i> also has <strong>View submissions only from specific users</strong> for <i>Bob</i>.</p>

## Configure your Account Settings:

Before configuring project sharing, you will need to open your __ACCOUNT SETTINGS__ and toggle the checkbox __Require authentication to see forms and submitted data__. If this configuration is left unchecked, setting row-level permissions will not work as expected.

## Managing Row Level Permissions:

In this example, three user accounts are presented to demonstrate how the feature works. _kalyan1_ represents the _admin_ or _owner_ of the survey project (as seen in the previous images). _kalyan2_ and _kalyan3_ represent different users receiving permissions. __Require authentication to see forms and submitted data__ has been checked for _kalyan1_.

### View submissions only from specific users:

_kalyan1_ can share row-level permissions with _kalyan2_, where they can _view_ submissions made from _kalyan2_.

Row-level permissions can also be set for _kalyan3_ such that they can only _view_ submissions made by _kalyan2_.

<video controls><source src="./_static/files/row_level_permissions/2_View_submissions_2.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

### Edit submissions only from specific users:

In this case, _kalyan1_ can share row-level permissions with _kalyan2_, where they can _view_ and _edit_ submissions made from _kalyan2_.

<video controls><source src="./_static/files/row_level_permissions/3_Edit_Submission_1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

As with view permissions, the same can be done for _kalyan3_ to only _view_ and _edit_ submissions from _kalyan2_.

<video controls><source src="./_static/files/row_level_permissions/4_Edit_Submission_2.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

### Delete submissions only from specific users:

In this case, _kalyan1_ can share row-level permissions with _kalyan2_, where they can _view_ and _delete_ submissions made from _kalyan2_.

<video controls><source src="./_static/files/row_level_permissions/5_Delete_Submissions_1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

The same can be done for _kalyan3_ to only _view_ and _delete_ submissions from _kalyan2_.

<video controls><source src="./_static/files/row_level_permissions/6_Delete_Submissions_2.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

### Validate submissions only from specific users:

In this case, _kalyan1_ can share row-level permissions with _kalyan2_ where they can _view_ and _validate_ submissions made from _kalyan2_.

<video controls><source src="./_static/files/row_level_permissions/7_Validate_Submissions_1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

The same can be done for _kalyan3_ to only _view_ and _validate_ submissions from _kalyan2_.

<video controls><source src="./_static/files/row_level_permissions/8_Validate_Submissions_2.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

## Troubleshooting:

### Scenario 1:

You may come across this dialogue box _(as shown in the image below)_ when submitting data with the __Require authentication to see forms and submitted data__ option checked in KoBoToolbox.

![image](/images/row_level_permissions/Login.png)

Enter your KoBoToolbox login credentials and, if the account has __Add submissions__ permission, you will be able to submit data to the server.

<p class="note">Note that itâ€™s advised not to share your admin login credentials when managing your project for data security. You can create multiple enumerator accounts and share those credentials with your team.</p>

### Scenario 2:

To set the _view_, _edit_, _delete_ and _validate_ row-level permissions correctly on submissions from a subset of users, the __Require authentication to see forms and submitted data__ option must be checked _before_ data is collected. Otherwise only data collected after this option is checked will be restricted as expected.
