# Converting Data into SPSS and/or Stata

**This article helps you convert your data into SPSS and Stata. Please note you need IBM SPSS and Stata which are third party apps**

Normally the data from our system can be exported as either XLS or CSV. This article helps you convert your data into SPSS and Stata. Kindly note that you need the third-party applications IBM SPSS and Stata to do this.

Since KoboToolbox does not export data directly in SPSS or Stata format, this workaround will help you make the conversion.

## Converting to SPSS

1. Download your data as XLS using the instructions provided in [this support article](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/export_download.html).  In summary, you can export data from the download tab as illustrated in the image below.

## Converting the SPSS file into a STATA file

Ensure you choose to save all the options you need when saving.
