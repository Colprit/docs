# Creating a New Form

To create a new form, click the **NEW** button on the **Project List View** (the
first screen after logging in to KoboToolbox).

You will be presented with 4 different options for creating your new form:

a. **Build from scratch** Choose this option if you want to build your form
using the formbuilder. After selecting this option, you will be required to
input the project details. After entering them, click **CREATE PROJECT**.

b. **Use a template** Use this option if you have a template in the Library
section that you would like to build upon using the formbuilder. Learn more
about the Library section [here](question_library.md)

c. **Upload an XLSForm** Import an existing form from an external file in the
[XLSForm format](http://xlsform.org/en). for example when sharing form drafts
between colleagues. You can learn more about creating forms using the XLSForm
standard [here](getting_started_xlsform.md).

d. **Import an XLSForm via URL** Use this option to import an XLSForm file that
is being hosted online, for example Google Sheets or Dropbox. For instructions,
visit [Importing an XLSForm via URL](xls_url.md).

## The Project List View

The **Project List View** shows all of the projects that you have been created,
and those shared with your account. To open a project, just click on its title.
In this view, you can also organize your projects (add project tags, archive, or
delete), download a project's form, or clone the form to use in a new project.

To open a project for editing in the formbuilder: Move your mouse over the title
of the project Click the <i class="k-icon k-icon-edit"></i> Edit button.
