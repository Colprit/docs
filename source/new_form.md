# Creating a New Form

You can **create a new form** in four different ways. When you click on the New button, your options are:

1. **Build from scratch**
    To create a new form from scratch, you can input project details and click __Create Project__.

3. **Use a template**
    To use a template, you need to first go to Library and create one.

4. **Upload an XLSForm**
    Import an existing form from an external file in the [XLSForm format](http://xlsform.org/en), for example when sharing form drafts between colleagues.

5. **Import an XLSForm via URL**
    Enter a valid XLSForm URL to import an existing form. For instructions, visit [Importing an XLSForm via URL](xls_url.md).

<p class="note">When creating very large forms (1000+ questions and high complexity), there is the possibility of the page hanging due to several reasons that are not limited to the browser, CPU, Internet connectivity, among others. In these cases, we recommend that you use XLSForm which is not constrained by this limitation.<p>

The **Project List View** shows all of the projects that have been created in, and shared with your account. To open a project, just click on its title. In this view, you can also organize your projects (add project tags, archive, or delete), download a project's form, or clone the form to use in a new project.

**Downloads** are possible in two different formats:

1. **XLS**
    Allowing you to share it with others through the XLSForm format, or edit it in a spreadsheet program such as Excel.

2. **XML**
    Allowing you to manually copy it to an Android device running KoBoCollect (only recommended for advanced users).
