# Transcription

KoboToolbox lets you transcribe audio files that you collect in your surveys.
Apart from adding transcriptions, you can also translate these transcripts into
different languages. The original transcript and all translated text is added as
new data columns and can be downloaded together with the rest of the data.

## How to add transcriptions

- In KoboToolbox, open your project and navigate to DATA -> Table
- Click the OPEN button next to the audio response you would like to translate.

- Select the original language of the audio file
- Click **transcribe**
- Type the transcript, then click save
- If done, click DONE

You will be taken back to the Table view where you will now notice that a new
column containing the transcript has been added.

## How to ass translations

## Language list

The new software features integrate ASR and MT capability provided by Google
Cloud Compute, which currently provides 72 languages for transcription
(including 138 regional variants) and 106 languages for translation. You can
also choose from a list of about 7,000 languages for doing manual transcription
or translation. This list was established using the ISO 639-3 comprehensive list
of languages, which is maintained by SIL International (filtered for "living
languages"). For any language that has ASR or MT, you are able to choose between
“manual” and “automatic” transcription or translation; for the remaining
languages only the manual method is available.

If you are unable to find a language in the list, please consider alternative
spellings. For now, all language names use their English names and spelling, for
example, Spanish rather than Español. For other languages, especially those
spoken by a smaller number of speakers, please consider whether there is an
alternative name of the language. For example, the Bura language spoken in
Northern Nigeria is listed as Bura-Pabir, but is also known to some people as
Bourrah, Babir, and other names.
