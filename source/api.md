# Using the API

KoBoToolbox has a number of advanced features built in based on our open source libraries, which include useful add-ons for advanced use cases. There are many ways to use our API. For some hands-on examples, see this post.

KoBoToolbox has two APIs for its primary tools, kpi and kc. Originally kc was the only api for deploying forms and retrieving data. Now, kpi is the primary API that should be used. 

The base URL depends on the server you are using: for most users it is https://kf.kobotoolbox.org or https://kobo.humanitarianresponse.info. Below we only use [kpi-url] to refer to this base URL.
