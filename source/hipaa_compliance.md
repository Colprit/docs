# HIPAA Compliance

Anyone willing to operate [their own, private instance of KoBoToolbox](kobo_your_servers.md) could do so in a HIPAA compliant way, for example by contracting with a hosting company that specializes in HIPAA compliance.

The [public KoBoToolbox servers](server.md) were not designed with the specific requirements of HIPAA in mind and, as such, carry no guarantee of HIPAA compliance. We do not yet have plans to redesign the infrastructure of these public instances in accordance with the specific security protocols of HIPAA, as this would come with a very substantial cost increase.
