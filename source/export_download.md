## Available download formats

You can download your data in multiple formats. As soon as any data has been
collected, the following formats are available for download:

-   XLS (formatted spreadsheet)
-   XLS (legacy version)
-   CSV (comma separated values)
-   CSV (legacy version)
-   Media Attachments (a zip folder of your photos, videos, or sound
    recordings - if applicable)
-   KML (a file containing all the GPS points collected - if applicable)
-   Excel Analyser
-   SPSS Labels

XLS and CSV (non legacy) export types have additional, one-time options that
allow you to chose the value and header format, decide whether or not to include
groups in headers, and customize the group separator.

## Process of downloading your data

-   After setting up the format and type of data, click the Export button.
-   Each new export can take a few seconds to be created and will be shown below
    in the Exports section of the page.
-   Each export is retained as a unique snapshot in the system, so it is
    possible to go back to previous non-deleted exports.

## Solving exports stuck in pending state

If you have XLS exports stuck in the pending state:

-   Remove the stuck exports by clicking on the red trash can icon for each one.
-   Retry the exports by clicking the "New Export" button.
-   Please note that any export stuck in the "Pending" state for longer than an
    hour will likely never succeed; if you encounter such an export, please feel
    free to delete it and create a new export.

You should not have any trouble creating new exports from this point forward,
but if you do, please don't hesitate to let us know on the
[community forum](https://community.kobotoolbox.org/).
