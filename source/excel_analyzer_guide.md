The Excel Data Analyzer was developed by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) in August of 2014. It can be used to analyse the data produced by any XLSForm and dataset, including but not limited to those generated by KoboToolbox.

A full documentation of the tool is available from OCHA on the [Humanitarian Response website here](https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/en/applications/kobotoolbox/document/kobotoolbox-excel-data-analyser-v123), in English or French.
