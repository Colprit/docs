2. Select the form you wish to fill out and enter data. 

3. Now you may go through and start answering all the questions (swiping your finger from right to left)

4. When you reach the end of the form click on **Save Form and Exit** (making sure the form is marked as 'finalized')

**4. Uploading finalized data to the server**

After you have completed forms, follow these steps to upload the collected data to your KoBoToolbox account and server. 

1. Make sure you are connected to the internet on your device.

2. From the home screen, click on **Send Finalized Form**

3. A list of your most recently collected forms appears.

4. Click **Select All** (or select just the ones you wish to send), then click **Send Selected**.

**Additional Tips:**

**Editing data in KoBoCollect**

Once you have completed filling out forms, its possible to edit and make corrections to the submitted data in KoBoCollect before sending them to the server. 

1. Select **Edit Saved Form** on the home screen of KoBoCollect.

2. You will see a list of Saved Forms. Choose the one that you wish to make corrections to.

3. Make changes as needed and then press **Save Form and Exit**. 

4. Repeat the process if you wish to make corrections to multiple Saved Forms. 

**Deleting Forms in KoBoCollect**

Once you have completed all of your data collection for a specific project and have submitted all the saved forms to your KoBoToolbox server, it's recommend to delete the Blank Forms and Saved Forms from KoBoCollect so that enumerators will not get mixed up when collecting data for other projects. To do this, select **Delete Saved Form** from the home screen. 

**Resetting View Sent Forms in KoBoCollect**

When you've submit completed forms from KoBoCollect to the KoBoToolbox server by clicking **Send Finalized Form**, you should be able to confirm that your submitted forms have reached the server by seeing them in the **View Sent Form** page. It can be nice to have them there until the end of data collection for a specific project, as it gives you the reference of how many data submissions have been sent to the server form that particular device. However, once the data collection for the project is over, it is recommended to reset **View Sent Form** from KoBoCollect as it may create confusion with the total number of completed submissions sent to the server in future projects. 

To reset **View Sent Form** from KoBoCollect follow these steps:

1. Open the **Admin Settings** by clicking on the **three dot icon** on the top right of the screen. 

2. Select **Reset application**... 

3. Check the box for **Saved forms (instances folder,instances database)** and then press **RESET**. When you see **Saved forms::Success**, then press OK.

**Hiding buttons and options within KoBoCollect**

Itâ€™s sometimes necessary to hide buttons within KoBoCollect to limit the activity and capabilities of enumerators in the app. You're able to hide many of the buttons available in KoBoCollect through the Admin Settings.

1. On the home screen click the **three dot icon** and select **Admin Settings**

2. At the bottom you will see the **User Access Control** which includes **Main Menu Settings**, **User Settings** and **Form Entry Settings**.

3. Select the buttons you would like to hide from the different screens. If you set an admin password, your enumerators won't be able to access the **Admin Settings** to change access to these buttons.
