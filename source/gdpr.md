## What is GDPR?

GDPR stands for [General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr-info.eu) and is a new comprehensive data protection law in the EU that replaces existing laws to strengthen the protection of personal data and the rights of the individual. It is a single set of rules, directly enforceable in each EU member state.
