# How to edit or delete a single submission

To edit or delete a submitted questionnaire, please follow the steps below. 

Please note: 

* If you're collecting data with the KoBoCollect app, once a form has been submitted to the server it is **not possible** to edit or delete a submission from KoBoCollect.  
* It is **not possible** to do bulk edit or deletions.


1. Open the *DATA* tab of your project, and then click on *Table* on the left. You will see two icon options to either **Open** or **Edit** a record in the first column of the data table.

2. You can view, validate, edit, or delete submissions by clicking the **OPEN** icon to open the *Submission Record* modal. Or you can click the **EDIT** icon to go directly to editing the submitted form.

    **NOTE: DELETING IS NOT REVERSIBLE.**
