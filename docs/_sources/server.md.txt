# Which Server Should I Use?

KoBoToolbox is free and open source software that can be installed on any computer or server. The vast majority of users use one of the two options: The [Humanitarian Server](https://kobo.humanitarianresponse.info) hosted by UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) or the [Non-Humanitarian Server](https://kf.kobotoolbox.org) hosted by KoBoToolbox. The use of KoBoToolbox on either server is free to everyone, but there are certain differences and limitations you should know:

Anyone working for an organization providing [humanitarian assistance](http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/data-guides/defining-humanitarian-aid.) is free to use the Humanitarian Server provided by OCHA. 

If you're using the **Non-Humanitarian Server** and plan to exceed the monthly submission or storage limits, please email [info@kobotoolbox.org](info@kobotoolbox.org) to discuss feasibility and potential extra costs. 

A **very important** thing to keep in mind is that sharing projects and data between the two servers is not possible. This means all users working on a shared project need to be using the same server to do so.
