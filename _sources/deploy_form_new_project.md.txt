# How to Deploy a Form to Start a New Data Collection Project

Once you are ready to begin starting or piloting your data collection for a particular project, click the **Deploy** button to make the form live and allow data collection to begin.

You can edit your form as many times as you like by clicking on the pencil icon **(1)**, which takes you to the form builder, or by downloading the XLSForm and replace the form **(2)** after you make the needed changes.

## Redeploying your form

You can save and deploy your project, make edits, and then redeploy your form to make the changes live - as many times as you like. 

You will be prompted to redeploy your form when you have made changes to your form that are not yet public.

After redeploying your form to make the changes live, you will then have access to the previous versions of your form, which can be cloned to create new projects.

## Using KoBoCollect

If you are using KoBoCollect on an Android device and you redeploy your form, you will need to delete your old blank form on your device and redo the [get blank form](kobocollect-android.md) process with internet access to update the form to the latest version.
