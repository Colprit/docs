<p class="note">Please note that <strong>changing</strong> the question type is currently not supported and may result in unexpected results. If the form has already been deployed, use a question with a different XML name, even if the label remains the same<p/>

## Deleting a Question

You can remove a question at any point by clicking on the red trash can. You'll be asked to confirm before it is permanently deleted from your form.

## Changing the Order of Your Questions

All your questions and groups can be moved to any position in the form. Just drag-and-drop it from its current position to where you want it to go, even at the very beginning or very end of the form.

## Changing Question Settings

To access advanced features for each question click on the Settings cog in the top-right corner of the question. Here you can modify further details of the question, such as skip logic, validating responses, setting question hints, making a question required, etc. More information on this is available in the respective sections for [Question Options](question_options.md), [Skip Logic](skip_logic.md), and [Validation Criteria](validation_criteria.md).

## Adding Questions to the Library

In order to reuse a question in future forms, you can click on 'Add Question to Library'. It will be saved in your Question Library as a copy, meaning that you can make further changes to the original question in the form or even delete it, without affecting the copy that has been placed in the library.
