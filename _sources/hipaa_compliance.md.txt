# HIPAA Compliance

KoBoToolbox uses Amazon Web Services, which by itself is not HIPAA compliant. However, you could contract a hosting company specialized in HIPAA and run KoBoToolbox on their servers. We know that using this level of security is very important to some users, but at the moment we donâ€™t have plans (yet) to move to this level of security, which comes with a very substantial cost increase.
